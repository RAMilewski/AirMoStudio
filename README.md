AirMoStudio
===========

AirMo Studio is a WebRTC Video Control Room in the browser.

By pushing video origination into the browser, we empower Mozilla communities worldwide to both record and stream their events
live over Air Mozilla without the need for expensive and complicated video production hardware.

You can play with the demo at https://people.mozilla.com/~rmilewski/AirMoStudio/
				
At this point we need help from WebRTC-literate Mozillians to turn this non-functioning demo into a live web app.

Still to do:

	Add WebRTC capability.

	Write a mobile app to stream a mobile device camera to AirMo Studio.

	Write a mobile app to stream a mobile device microphone to AirMo Studio.
	
	Write an app to capture the AirMo studio output and re-stream on Air Mozilla.
